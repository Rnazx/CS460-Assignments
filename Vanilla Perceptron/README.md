-The link to the data-set is https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tic-Tac-Toe+Endgame<br/>
-We have taken 'x' value to be 0.5, 'o' value to be -0.5 and 'b' value to be 0.0<br/>
-It is observed that even thought the accuracy of the first few epochs in all three methods are somewhat similar, Vanilla perceptron does not classify all the games to 
100% accuracy after a point even though you increase the number of epochs.It saturates while the voted and average perceptron algorithms don't.<br/>
-The data is split randomly into training and testing data in the ratio 80:20.<br/>
