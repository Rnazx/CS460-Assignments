How do we choose a good k for clustering?
Look at the dataset.Try with different ks. if we are getting the centroids of the clusters as very close then our k is too small.



Using DBSCAN:
We maybe can calculate the maximum distance between any two point in the dataset and choose this as the epsilon for DBSCAN and 
then the number of clusters obtained will probably be the optimal k for Kmeans
