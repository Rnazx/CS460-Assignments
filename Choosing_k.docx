How do we choose a good k for clustering?
Look at the dataset.Try with different ks. if the standard deviatiion of one of the cluster from the centroid is too large while compared to other clusters, then our k is too small.
Basically we are saying that if the mean is skewd toward one set of the cluster then it is probably better to split it up into two clusters.
